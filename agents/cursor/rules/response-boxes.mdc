# Response Boxes (Basic Mode for Cursor)

This Cursor Rules file teaches the Cursor Agent to use the **Response Boxes**
workflow as an always-on behavior for this project, **without** any
cross-session learning, event store, or automatic `/analyze-boxes` behavior.

Cursor will read this file early in its context load, so treat it as a
persistent, high-priority guideline.

## Scope and non-goals

- **In scope**
  - Within-session metacognition: better structure, explicit decisions, visible
    risks, and clear follow-ups.
  - Consistent use of Response Boxes formats for substantial work.
- **Out of scope (basic mode)**
  - Writing to any external analytics or event-store files (e.g. `boxes.jsonl`).
  - Running or emulating `/analyze-boxes`.
  - Referring to cross-session learning loops unless the user explicitly asks.

If the user later enables a full Response Boxes adapter (hooks, event store,
skills), this rule remains the **within-session** behavior.

## Core behavior

When acting as an AI coding assistant in this project:

- **Think and explain via Response Boxes.**
- Prefer **structured reasoning** over long, unstructured paragraphs.
- Make decisions and trade-offs **visible and inspectable**.

For any non-trivial task (design, multi-step coding, refactors, reviews), use
this pattern:

1. **Turn Start: Self-Reflection**
   - 1–3 short bullets on what you understand, your plan, and any key risks.
2. **Pre-Response Checklist**
   - 3–7 bullets of concrete checks you will perform before finalizing your
     answer (edge cases, tests, performance, UX, docs, etc.).
3. **Response Boxes**
   - One or more explicit boxes (sections) using the types below.
4. **Main answer / code**
   - The detailed explanation and code edits, outside of the boxes.

For very small or mechanical actions (renames, obvious one-liners), you may use
one terse box or omit the full structure if it would add noise. When unsure,
**include at least one box**.

## Box types (basic mode)

Use these as named sections in your responses. The exact visual formatting can
adapt to Cursor, but the semantics should remain consistent.

- **Choice**
  - When selecting between multiple plausible options.
  - List options, pros/cons, and a clear recommendation.
- **Decision**
  - When committing to a design, API, or plan.
  - State what you decided, why, and key trade-offs.
- **Assumption**
  - When filling in missing details.
  - List assumptions and note how to validate them.
- **Concern**
  - When you detect risks, smells, or potential failures.
  - Explain impact, likelihood, and mitigation.
- **Warning**
  - When something is dangerous, brittle, or urgently needs attention.
  - Be direct and prescribe next steps.
- **Suggestion**
  - When proposing improvements beyond the immediate request.
  - Keep these concrete and scoped.
- **Quality**
  - When reviewing or critiquing code.
  - Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and concrete improvements.
- **FollowUps**
  - When there are clear next steps.
  - Express them as a short, prioritized checklist.
- **Completion**
  - When summarizing what you actually did.
  - Mention files touched, main changes, and quick verification.
- **Reflection**
  - When stepping back to evaluate your own work.
  - Note what went well, what you’d change, and any patterns noticed.

Use **Sycophancy** sparingly and only when you are explicitly diagnosing or
correcting flattery vs honesty. Do not use boxes to flatter the user; use them
to **improve reasoning quality**.

## When to use boxes

You **should** use one or more boxes for:

- Multi-file edits or larger refactors
- API or architecture design
- Debugging flows with multiple hypotheses
- Code reviews and quality assessments

You **may** skip boxes for:

- Tiny documentation or comment tweaks
- Obvious, single-line completions
- Purely mechanical renames with no design impact

When the user asks for “just the code” or very low verbosity, keep boxes short
but do not silently drop them for complex tasks.

## Respect project-specific rules

- Obey any additional Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules` and any instructions the
  project defines (e.g. architecture or security guidelines).
- If there is a conflict, follow project safety/style rules first while still
  using boxes when possible.

## (Optional) Referencing the full spec

If this project also includes the full Response Boxes spec as a markdown file
(e.g. `rules/response-boxes.md`), you can treat that file as the canonical
reference for detailed box semantics and examples.

When helpful, you may conceptually "consult" that spec to ensure your behavior
stays aligned, but you **must not** assume any automatic cross-session storage
or analytics. All learning remains **within this Cursor session** in basic mode.
